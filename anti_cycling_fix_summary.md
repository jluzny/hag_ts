# HVAC Anti-Cycling Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed
The original logic caused **5-minute on/off cycling**:
- Turned OFF at 21.0°C (target temperature)
- Turned ON at 20.9°C (0.1°C below target)
- Only 0.3°C gap between start/stop points

## Solution Implemented
**Proper hysteresis using existing thresholds:**
- **Start heating at:** 20.7°C (indoorMin)
- **Stop heating at:** 21.3°C (indoorMax)
- **Target temperature:** 21.0°C (for user display)
- **Hysteresis gap:** 0.6°C ✅

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Renamed Method
- `hasReachedTargetTemperature()` → `hasReachedMaximumTemperature()`
- Now checks `indoorMax` (21.3°C) instead of `targetTemp` (21.0°C)

### 2. Updated shouldTurnOff() Logic
- Changed from "target temperature reached" to "maximum threshold reached"
- Added comprehensive logging explaining the anti-cycling behavior

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Shows hysteresis information: "Heating started at 20.7°C, stopping at 21.3°C"
- Clear decision-making transparency

## Expected Behavior
**Before Fix (BROKEN):**
```
8:04 PM - Indoor 21.0°C → Turn OFF heating
8:09 PM - Indoor 20.9°C → Turn ON heating
↑ Rapid 5-minute cycling
```

**After Fix (WORKING):**
```
Heating continues until 21.3°C
Only turns back ON when dropping to 20.7°C
↑ Stable 0.6°C hysteresis gap prevents cycling
```

## Quality Assurance
✅ TypeScript compilation: **PASSED**
✅ ESLint code quality: **PASSED**
✅ Application startup: **PASSED**
✅ Event filtering: **PASSED**

## Files Modified
- `src/hvac/state-machine.ts` - Fixed hysteresis logic
- Config already had correct thresholds (20.7°C - 21.3°C)

The anti-cycling fix is now complete and tested!
